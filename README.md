# R5hmCFDV
R5hmCFDV: Computational identification of RNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine based on deep feature fusion and deep voting
(i)Feature files are used to extract features.
(ii)Fusion is used to fuse features. It mainly uses the attention mechanism, convolution layer, BiGRU and BiLSTM.
(iii)A deep ensemble learning algorithm is designed to predict 5hmC sites.
